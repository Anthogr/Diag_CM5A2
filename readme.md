For more information about launching the script on IRENE, check out the __IRENE_GEN2212__ branch.

_Based on the [Alexandre Phol's work](https://github.com/alexpohl/genie_basicdiags)_

The scripts and functions have been reworked to match the CM5A2 model's outputs

## Usage

Run locally:
- Set variables in __PARAMETERS TO DEFINE__ section in `Diag_CM5A2.py` (more information at the top of the script) before running it.
