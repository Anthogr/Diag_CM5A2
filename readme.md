_Based on the Alexandre Phol's work_ ([Link](https://github.com/alexpohl/genie_basicdiags))

The scripts and functions have been reworked to match the CM5A2 model's outputs

## Usage

Run locally:
- Set variables in __PARAMETERS TO DEFINE__ section in `Diag_CM5A2.py` (more informations at the top of the script) before running it.
